# Video Display Project

This project is a web application for displaying videos.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file for the user interface.
- `style.css`: Contains the styles for the application.
- `script.js`: Contains the client-side JavaScript logic.
- `run.py`: A Python script, likely for a backend API or processing.
- `api.txt`: Potentially contains API information or notes.

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the application.
2. The backend might need to be run separately using the `run.py` script.
